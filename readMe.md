##Introduction and file objective:

- Start a vue project with a default structure thanks to an .sh file.
- I've done this file because after used some CLI related with vue, I always need to adapt the code (adapt router, add sass, adapt folder structure / mutations and actions, ...).
- I used [link to Vuelidate](https://monterail.github.io/vuelidate/)  to install all the basic.

## TODO:
- See if better to use [new Official Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org) now.

#### Feel free to use it and to custom it if you want!
