## Introduction and file objective:

- Start a vue project with a default structure thanks to an .sh file.
- I've done this file because after used some CLI related with vue, I always need to adapt the code (adapt router, add sass, adapt folder structure / mutations and actions, ...).
- With this .sh file, I have a project which is entirely configurate like I wish. If I have to adapt some things, changes are very easy to do with this file.
- I used [CLI for vue2](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) 

## TODO:
- See if better to use [new Official Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org) now.

#### Feel free to use it and custom if you want!
